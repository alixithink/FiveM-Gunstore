# FiveM-Gunstore

This script was created to make it easier to configure and the obvious reason being so you can go into a gun store and buy a weapon.

Within the config.lua you are able to configure almost everything.

Config.amLocation - Locations for the stores.

- Config.doMisc - Weapons that show up in the misc section.
- Config.doAmmo - Ammo options that display in the buy ammo section (Best not to alter this section but do it if you need to.)
